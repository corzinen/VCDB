    "summary": "CT Group is embroiled in a legal battle with its ex-pollster Michael Turner and his new business, alleging data was stolen, including client proposals and financial, research and poll reports.  The claim is denied by Mr Turner and his new outfit Freshwater Strategy, which called the claims “spurious and unfounded”  In a statement of claim filed in the NSW Supreme Court, CT Group alleges Mr Turner connected an external hard drive to a laptop used during his employment at the company. It is alleged he moved data from the laptop to folders on the external hard drive.  “The information contained in the data files is information that was acquired or created by Mr Turner during the course of or in connection to his employment with Crosby Textor,” the statement of claim said.A Freshwater spokesman said, “we believe these claims only demonstrate how desperate our former employer is to prevent us setting a precedent for leaving”.
