    "summary": "Citi Trendsâ€™ filing with the Attorney General of Montana provides some important information on what led up to the breach. According to this source, around January 14, 2023, Citi Trends was the target of a cyberattack. In response, Citi Trends blocked all unauthorized access to its computer network and then launched an investigation with the help of outside cybersecurity experts.  As a result of this investigation, Citi Trends determined that an unauthorized party was able to access its network, including files that contained confidential information relating to employees and prospective employees.  After learning that sensitive employee data was accessible to an unauthorized party, Citi Trends reviewed the compromised files to determine what information was leaked and which consumers were impacted. While the breached information varies depending on the individual, it may include your name, Social Security number and financial account information. ",
