    "summary": "Wading into the politics of trans youth treatment, a reporter published an account talking about specific cases.  In Singal's response, he shared screenshots from an Excel document that Reed had given him as proof to support her claims. It seems that Reed had kept her own, private records about the trans youth at the clinic where she worked, whom she thought were being mistreated or misled by the medical staff (despite not being a medical professional herself). Reed also provided Singal with more specific patient details of the kind that were otherwise absent from her initial account.",
