    "summary": "News of the HomecareGPS data breach is still fresh; however, what we know at this point comes from the company’s filing with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights. However, the information provided on the HHS-OCR website is limited. Thus, all that can be gleaned from the site is that the breach involved a “hacking/IT incident.” Based on the HHS-OCR filing, the Elgon Information Systems data breach affected 31,248 individuals.  Upon discovering that sensitive consumer data was made available to an unauthorized party, HomecareGPS began to review the affected files to determine what information was compromised and which consumers were impacted. While HomecareGPS has not yet publicly released the data types that were compromised, the company filed notice of the breach with HHS-OCR, which means that the incident likely involved the protected health information of affected parties.",
