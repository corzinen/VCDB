    "summary": "A now-former Stryker employee is denying allegations that she stole trade secrets from the company.  Stryker Corporation, which is headquartered in Portage MI, filed a federal lawsuit against Carrie Hendrick, alleging she downloaded confidential information and deleted more than 400 files from the companyâ€™s servers, according to documents filed  Thursday, March 2 in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan.  According to MLive, Stryker alleged that Hendrick caused damages to the company of $25,000 or more. Hendrick denied the allegations in a March 9 response to the lawsuit.  She resigned in July of 2022 after working at Stryker in Virginia for about two years.  Her attorney however in response said in a legal filing that Hendrick did not improperly access files and download confidential information onto flash drives as Stryker accused of her doing.",
