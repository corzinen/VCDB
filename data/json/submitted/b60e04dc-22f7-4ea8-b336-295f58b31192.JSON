    "summary": "Nearly 600 White Bird Clinic patients had their personal health information accidentally shared after an employee sent an email containing the information to an incorrect email address last month, according to White Bird.  Clinic officials said the employee sent the email on Jan. 6. It contained a report with patients' full name, date of birth, medical record number, dates of service, insurance and demographic information. Officials said it did not contain social security numbers, addresses, credit card or other financial information.  White Bird said it became aware of the breach on Jan. 9. The clinic said it contacted the person who received the information and the incorrect recipient deleted the data immediately, officials said.",
