The investigation is still ongoing, but the hospitals assured patients that its IT team identified the attack in a timely manner and took efforts to keep patient information secure.  “Until we feel confident the virus has been fully removed, some clinics will be closed, Idaho Falls Community Hospital will divert ambulances to nearby hospitals and normal workflows may look a little different,” the notice stated. “Patients will be contacted by their provider if their appointments are impacted.”  Surgeries are continuing as scheduled and the hospitals’ emergency departments remain open.",
