    "summary": "Toledo Police Department is revisiting its safety procedures after authorized documentation was found in the trash.  A local blogger posted a video of documents he found in trash bins outside of Toledo Police Department’s SWAT headquarters.  Blogger Aaron Collins showed 13abc the sensitive suspect information he found in the trash outside TPD’s Swat Building.  “All this information is here; if I wanted to, I could have peoples’ identities,” Collins said. He added that the information could put a person’s life in danger. “If I were inclined to, I could say, ‘hey the police are looking for you’, or ‘hey, here’s where this guy is. Go get your man’”.”  Collins told 13abc he found the documents last week: paperwork with social security numbers, birthdays, alias, and addresses. He said there were even documents with information about TPD officers.  “This one is a police officer’s home address,” Collins said.",
