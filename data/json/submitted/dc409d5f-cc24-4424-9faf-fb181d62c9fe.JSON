Morris Hospital recently detected unusual activity on its network and later discovered that an unauthorized third-party had accessed its network. Morris Hospital & Healthcare Centers (Morris Hospital) has issued a notification concerning a cybersecurity incident they discovered on April 4. The incident affects  current and former patients of Morris Hospital and current and former employees and their dependents or beneficiaries.  According to their explanation, their forensic investigation determined that “just prior to the incident,” data was exfiltrated to an external storage platform by an unauthorized individual or individuals. The exported files contained records with  the names, addresses, dates of birth, social security numbers, medical record numbers and account numbers, and diagnostic codes of current and former healthcare patients at Morris Hospital AND the names, addresses, social security numbers, and dates of birth of current and former employees and their dependents and beneficiaries.",
